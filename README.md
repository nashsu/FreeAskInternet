## What is FreeAskInternet
FreeAskInternet is a completely free, private and locally running search aggregator & answer generate using LLM, Without GPU needed. The user can ask a question and the system will use searxng to make a multi engine search and combine the search result to the ChatGPT3.5 LLM and generate the answer based on search results. All process running locally and  No GPU or OpenAI or Google API keys are needed.



## Features 

- 🈚️ Completely FREE (no need for any API keys)
- 💻 Completely LOCAL (no GPU need, any computer can run )
- 🔐 Completely PRIVATE (all thing running locally)
- 👻 Runs WITHOUT LLM Hardware (NO GPU NEED!)
- 🤩 Using Free ChatGPT3.5 API (NO API keys need! Thx OpenAI)
